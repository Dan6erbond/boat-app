# Boat App

Boat CRUD application featuring a Spring Boot RESTful API and React frontend.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
 - Docker w/ Docker Compose CLI

### Dev Setup

This project comes with a `docker-compose.dev.yml` file, which starts a Postgres container for development and exposes port 5432 for database connections.

The React app can be launched with React-Scripts `start` command and Spring Boot API with `mvnw spring-boot:run` (`mvnw.cmd` on Windows).

### Running the App

To run all the services with Docker Compose, run the `docker compose up --build` command which will use the [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) file to start the services and expose the API on port 8080 as well as the frontend on port 3000. Launch the app at http://localhost:3000/.

## Architecture

There are two main services:

 - Frontend: React app using [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview). Scaffolded with the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) boilerplate.
 - API: Spring Boot RESTful API with authentication using [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security), [JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) and [HATEOAS](https://spring.io/projects/spring-hateoas). Boilerplate and constructors are generated at runtime using [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/).

## Expansions

This section lists possible expansions to improve the application which have not yet been implemented.
